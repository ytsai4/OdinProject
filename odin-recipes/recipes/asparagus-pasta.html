            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>
              Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil.
              Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring
              occasionally, for about 8 minutes. Penne will still be slightly
              firm.

          <section class="steps">
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>
              Stir asparagus into the pot with the boiling penne pasta and bring
              back to a boil; cook until pasta is tender and asparagus is
              softened but still bright green, about 3 more minutes. Drain pasta
              and asparagus.
            </p>

            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>
              Place penne and asparagus into a large bowl; lightly stir in lemon
              zest, lemon juice, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, salt, and black
              pepper until thoroughly combined.
