          <section class="steps">
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>
              Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook
              spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until
              tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.

          <section class="steps">
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>
              Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add
              onions and cook until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add
              garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in
              mushrooms and bell pepper; cook until bell pepper has softened and
              mushrooms are lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Add shrimp, white
              wine, and oregano. Cook until shrimp are almost cooked through and
              turning pink, 3 to 5 minutes.
            </p>

          <section class="steps">
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <p>
              Add cream and butter. Simmer, stirring constantly, for 8 minutes.
              Add cooked spaghetti, mix to combine, and turn off heat. If cream
              sauce is too thin, thicken with flour. Season with salt and pepper
              and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and basil.
